 Light weight on vegetables


 I have two recipes this week that both came with "10oz" of bok choi.

One of the bags was obviously much smaller than the other, so i weighed them both.

One was 5.5 oz, one was 8.5 oz.

I know that vegetables have their own sizes, both packages had two bok choi in it. But 5.5 oz?  Clearly needed a THIRD one of
the same size added. And even the big one
at 8.5 oz is short -- vegetables are not uniform sizes, but do they ever go over so
it averages out, or always under?

This isn't just "getting what I was promised" -- this effects the nutritional content of the food and the general healthfulness of it. I choose my recipes based on the
nutritional info and on having enough vegetables for my dietary goals,  and count on there being the expected quantity of vegetables. Some of the recipes really don't have enough veggies for me as written and I try to avoid those, but when I'm picking
a recipe advertised as having so much veggies but they send me less, bah!

 How often do you have issues?


 I feel like I’m complaining every week. Either a missing ingredient, an open package, the meat smells, or some combination of the three. Last week I was missing snowpeas, and the roasted red peppers were open/spilled all inside the bag. The week before the beef smelled so bad I was gagging just to throw it away.

I hate complaining but I hate paying for something I can’t use more. I’ve only been
using blue apron since the end of December, and I went through and I’ve only had 2 boxes without issues. Is this normal? Am I
picky? I have really enjoyed blue apron, aside from the issues.

 BA uses a lot of arugula. I hate arugula. Ways I can tolerate it / cook it / use it in other BA meals?


 This week I got the mushroom grilled cheese with pear and arugula salad.

I also got the basil fettuccine with spinach. I try to be creative with not tossing
ingredients and I want to try to like arugula.

Apologies if this is more of a general cooking question, but I’d like to hear stories of anyone else swapping ingredients between the meals they ordered. I don’t really keep groceries around, so I’m limited to
whatever BA sends.

At this point, I am willing to marinate arugula in the cooling gel from the frozen pouch and garnish it with recipe card shavings if that’s what it takes.


 Meal choice compared to other services?


 Hey all. My first Blue Apron box arrives
tomorrow. Looking forward to giving this service a try. I'm new to the meal kit community, but as a busy parent I'm a full convert.

I started with Hello Fresh, which was good, and decided to give this one a try. Out
of the gate I notice there seem to be fewer choices for the meals each week. Am I just missing something? Maybe I need to use
the app to see more choices or something like that? It only looked like there are maybe 8 standard meals and 2 heat and eat options. Is that accurate?



 Repeats?


 I love the variety of the recipes, but I
really enjoyed the tilapia with the orange salsa. Do they ever repeat recipes?


 Source for peppers?


 Does anyone know where to get the sweety
drop peppers or the pickled peppadew peppers?


 mysterious blue apron delivery


 my partner and i received a blue apron box recently. we did not order from blue apron and in fact never have. is this an automated amazon doing? or has someone played
a prank on us? does anyone have any idea?



 Lentils and Farro stuffed peppers


 This was delicious and healthy. I found out that you can get Farro and black lentils at whole foods. I'm trying to find romesco sauce.


 How often do you get Blue Apron?


 Just wanting to see how often everyone gets Blue Apron
