Subreddit: HelloFresh

**START**


 They give us so many free box codes [that aren't a discount for us but something we have to pitch to others] [that aren't actually a free box anyway] that it feels like I am in an MLM scheme



 the rewards are such such trash. give ME a discounted box. give ME a free box after 10. give ME a free market item once in a while.

christ.



 Flabbergasted. My experience today with a hello fresh agent as a HFer for 5 years and 200+ boxes. I had to share.






 I am doing this every single time now. Paid extra for the valentines meal and this is what I got. Absolutely ridiculous





 Shout out HelloFresh for the generous portion of garlic!!






 “One teaspoon chili flakes”






 Psst, ya'll, come in close. Do you think Hello Fresh is in cahoots with Big Green Onion?



 I have a theory they are working together to trick us all into eating green onions constantly. It's a conspiracy I tell ya! It's like all those Got
Milk? ads years ago, but much more nefarious.

I am onto you, Big Green Onion! I separate the whites from the greens on my own terms.



 The original recipe ingredients for Fire Cracker Meatballs







 Remember that miracles happen in a large pan on medium-high heat, seasoned all over with salt and pepper.







 Can I just say that Hello Fresh has *really* helped me get into cooking!



 Seriously, I am in my 20s and only know the basics. I feel so much more capable after having >1 month of HF experience. Now, I don’t do takeout anymore and I cook from scratch even on my off days from HF. I have learned basics on ingredients from staple veggies, seasonings, etc. I feel like now, I can move away from HF with confidence. Except that I want to continue cooking 1-2 HF meals/week until I get really comfortable. I’m so glad that
gone are the days of boxed mac and cheese and ramen

Edit added some details



 Hello Fresh is very considerate of me, seeing as I am a vampire who hates garlic.







 Beef tenderloin with cheddar-Gouda fondue! OMG 10/10. I added the chicken and some sausage to really go all out for date night






 Time for GARLIC Butter Shrimp Scampi!







 Used a new customer code for the 11th time


 I make a new email account and get a box for ~20 bucks with free shipping then immediately cancel.

I called support once, because I forgot the email address that I used to create the account but still had to cancel, so they found me by name in their database. Their reaction was, "Wow, there's 11 other people named Rex Bosworth in this town who have used Hellofresh, how strange"



 Shout out to my delivery guy. I have no idea how he managed to squeeze the box in the hole, because I certainly wasn't able to pull it out in one piece. Hopefully everything is still safe to eat though!






 Dear HF, limes exist too.



 Mexican and Thai dishes go much better with limes instead of lemons. I know you have stock in lemon production since it comes with every recipe, but please keep in mind limes do exist!  :)

I personally keep limes and garlic bulbs on hand at all times to adjust accordingly.



 “Chicken strips” that were actual chicken strips!!! I even had to cut them for the enchiladas!!







 Anyone else use Hello Fresh as meal prep for the week?






 So *that’s* why my ingredients are always damaged…



 Was coming home today and witnessed my HelloFresh box being delivered. By “delivered”, though, I mean the guy got out of his van, picked up my box, and chucked it from shoulder height on to the steps of my building several feet away. The package landed with a lovely THUD as the guy casually walked back to his van to chuck more boxes at other buildings.

Yeehaw.



 Is this normal, my first time ordering a box and ive only heard about the legends of the one clove garlic, i got a whole garlic somehow







 my boyfriend and I tried hello fresh for the first time


 we really loved hello fresh. it made cooking so easy. it is just kind of expensive without the coupon code.
