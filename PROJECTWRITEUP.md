# **Project Write-up**
## Assignment 2

The data sources I chose to use for my mini-project are the Subreddit pages for three competing brands in the meal kit industry: HelloFresh, Home Chef, and Blue Apron. These pages are not affiliated with the companies, so the content is directed by the customer's voice. For each Subreddit, I scraped the post title and post text (description) of the top 20 posts of the month. A month is an appropriate period to capture enough posts that are ranked highly and demonstrated as relevant to helping other customers understand the brand and form their opinions. The techniques I used for analysis and processing include web scraping, data cleaning, word: frequency dictionaries, summary statistics, dictionaries with words that appear in a subreddit but not the word file, a random word generator, sentiment analysis, Markov Text Synthesis (sentence generator), and some data visualization. Through these methods, I wanted to gain insight into the customer's voice on Reddit and the perceived differences in the brands. The customer's voice on Reddit is vital for advertising, as a best practice is to mimic the Redditor's type of humor and "authenticity." As a marketer in the direct-to-consumer space, I also wanted to understand some of the customers' pain points and what keywords to focus on in advertisement messaging. I essentially wanted to create some tools to guide marketing efforts and understand the differences between these similar companies.

As for implementation, I used different data structures to help produce my desired results. I created dictionaries that matched words to their frequency of appearance in the text for each company. These dictionaries removed headers, white space, and punctuation, which helped get cleaner results in the analysis portion of the project. I referenced these dictionaries throughout my analysis, namely for the summary statistics where word frequency mattered the most. I also chose to create a dictionary when looking at words that appeared in the subreddits and not the word file because it allowed me to get the output I wanted with less code. To get results in a format that looked better than that of a dictionary, I would often convert my data into lists. Despite the slight efficiency of tuples over lists, I chose to use lists because they help store data in a way that keeps it all together as one variable. In the case of the data I was using and how I structured my code, I did not need to create immutable tuples. 

I also chose to run functions and create data structures independently for each of my data sources, rather than combining them in one dictionary or list. I made this decision because I wanted to compare each company without having to do further processing to separate them from each other later on. I did not have any objectives to analyze the data together, as I wanted to understand the brands independently. Another decision I had to make was what analysis to do. I decided to go forward and do all of the basic analysis from class because I realized it could generate some insight. I also chose to do a sentiment analysis of each of the brands because I wanted to understand customers' emotions to improve marketing and product development efforts. In essence, the sentiment analysis was vital for me to execute to understand the difference in public opinion between the three brands I was analyzing. I also chose to do a sentence generator using Markov Text Synthesis because I was interested in seeing some patterns among the data. This type of algorithm helps get a quick and short synopsis of each subreddit to understand what customers are saying about the brand. The sentence generator makes it easy to quickly compare the keywords and opinions of the customers engaging with the brand on Reddit. The sentence generator can also be used to help marketers advertise in the voice of the customer on the Reddit platform.

I found it interesting that Blue Apron scored much higher than the other two companies in terms of having a negative sentiment. This finding can suggest that Blue Apron customers are experiencing more problems with their meal kits, whether a bag opened during shipping, they were sent some rotten food, or the product includes an unnecessary amount of plastic packaging. I also found it interesting that HelloFresh scored the highest in terms of positive sentiment. I hypothesized that this might be the case, as HelloFresh is the market leader, meaning they have more resources to improve the product according to customer opinion. It was also interesting that the Home Chef text generated a negativity score of 0.0. Through research on other social media platforms, such as Youtube, Facebook, and Tiktok, I learned that people tend to like Home Chef and rarely have problems with the food quality, packaging, and price of the product (compared to meal kit alternatives). As for the number of different words on each subreddit, I was surprised that Home Chef had much fewer words than HelloFresh and Blue Apron. However, it was also the case that Home Chef had significantly fewer words in total (322 total words on Home Chef, 716 total words on HelloFresh, and 755 total words on Blue Apron). These findings suggest that Home Chef customers are less engaged on Reddit than its competitors. I assume that the 'top posts' on the Home Chef subreddit are less descriptive than that of HelloFresh and Blue Apron because there is less competition in becoming a top post due to the lower user base on the subreddit. Home Chef is also a smaller company than HelloFresh and BlueApron. This could mean that they have less resources to advertise on Reddit and attract less customers that are likely to engage and create top posts on the Home Chef subreddit.

It was also pretty interesting to see the Markov Text Synthesizer program results. As seen below in the examples, the output was pretty funny and provided a good summary of some of the customers' top opinions and concerns. For HelloFresh, it was interesting to see that it pulled a sentence about canceling the subscription after getting a discount on the first box. These meal kit companies are notorious for providing huge discounts for new customers. My research suggests that many customers play the system and create new accounts to get the attractive discount. I also thought it was interesting that it generated a sentence comparing takeout to HelloFresh and provided evidence with a commitment to the brand. For Home Chef, it was interesting that the generated sentences included two supermarket names: Whole Foods and Kroger. These results can direct the Home Chef marketing team to test campaigns where they position themselves against these retailers. For Blue Apron, it was not surprising that two of the generated comments were complaints. These sentences align with the sentiment analysis results, where Blue Apron had the highest negative score compared to the other brands. In essence, the results of the text synthesizer are entertaining but may not be super valuable. The results help get a quick summary of what people are saying about the brand on Reddit, may provide some ideas to test in marketing, and may be useful if a brand is trying to artificially grow Reddit engagement on these subreddits by creating bots that speak similarly to existing customers. However, I believe there are better methods than this text generator that may guide a marketing team towards deeper insights or better results. 

**Some examples for HelloFresh include:** 
- Is this normal, my first time ordering a box for ~20 bucks with free shipping then immediately cancel.
- Now, I don't do takeout anymore and I tried hello fresh agent as a HFer for 5 years and 200+ boxes.
- Can I just say that Hello Fresh is in cahoots with Big Green Onion!

**Some examples for Home Chef include:**
- I bought popcorn chicken at kroger but I don't know what type of steak homechef uses for their streak strips?
- My local whole foods is able to thinly cut any steak for me but I cannot find the nutritional facts and it's a little frustrating
- If so, which ones are your go-to's or tips for ordering?

**Some examples for Blue Apron include:**
- One of the recipes really don't have enough veggies for me as written and I went through and I've only had 2 boxes without issues
- The week before the beef smelled so bad I was missing snowpeas, and the roasted red peppers were open/spilled all inside the bag
- Last week I got the basil fettuccine with spinach.

Reflecting on this project, I could have done a lot more and developed the architecture more efficiently, given I had more experience in Python and these tasks. Because I am new to programming, it is pretty difficult to understand what to do from a big picture perspective and think about how everything fits together. During this project, I got stuck on small details in the coding, which took a long time for me to debug. I attempted to do other methods of sentiment analysis and markov text synthesis. Eventually, I chose to use a more basic approach because I kept getting stuck on certain parts of the code. Before I started coding, I could have taken more time to develop a thorough plan and map things out to be more efficient. This plan could have reduced the time spent on the coding portion because it would have limited my confusion throughout the project. I could have also spent more time figuring out how to properly remove the stop words when generating the most common words in each text. When I tried to remove the stop words, my code stopped generating output. I spent a few hours trying to figure it out and eventually stopped to ensure that I could finish my project on time. If I didn't get stuck on so many details and if I understood programming on a deeper level, I could have used more complex analysis, which could have helped fulfill my goals to a better degree. Going forward, I will use what I learned for the team project where we plan to do further text analysis. Now that I have gained some knowledge on how to perform these tasks, I believe that I can spend more time learning how to apply them best and make my program more efficient. I also think that I can use Python in the future for summary statistics and generating graphs. I found that creating charts on Python is much easier than on Excel, as I prefer to type out the colors I am looking for, the boldness of the font, and so forth, rather than clicking a bunch of buttons on Excel to create a visually appealing chart. I have become more confident in my ability to perform text analysis and believe that I can use Python to perform similar tasks in the future, whether for personal or professional projects.
